# LFR-Code
The codebase for a working <strong>Line Following Robot</strong> which can follow a black line.
Download the <strong>new1.ino</strong> and upload it to your Arduino Board.
This code has relatively lesser conditions for different turning angles.
Also this code has been written for a IR sensor array containing 8 pairs of emitters and recievers but this code can be modified easily for any number of sensors.
